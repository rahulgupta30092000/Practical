    <p>A closure can be defined as a JavaScript feature in which the inner function has access to the outer function variable. In JavaScript, every time a closure is created with the creation of a function.
A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).</p>
